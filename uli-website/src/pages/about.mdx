## About Uli

Navigating the online world has increasingly become reflective of the offline world: targeted gender-based violence against all gender and sexual minorities is now commonplace. Uli (meaning chisel in Tamil) is our attempt to hand the chisel and power over to users most affected by online gender-based violence. Uli invites each one of us to gather around and take control of our experience on social media platforms. With Uli, we lay the groundwork to demand more responsible and proactive tech from the powers to be.

This plugin is also an ode to the efforts of different groups, organizations and movements that strive to empower each one of us. It was born from the collective labour of journalists, activists, community influencers, and writers engaged in the struggle against the interwoven caste, religion, gender and sexuality-based violence both online and offline. They have contributed towards the development of this plugin that allows us to filter out offensive words/phrases, call our friends for help or start online conversations, and archive problematic tweets. This plugin is a reminder of our ability to reclaim spaces and take control of our online experience.

Uli is not the final product, rather it’s a simple tool, a chisel, that allows one to make a room of one’s own or courtyards where people can come together, share stories, and reflect on the future we all want to see.

## Support the Project

Broadly, the project would require support for:

- Research and technical development
- Compensating expert annotators
- Infrastructure cost

In the first year, we piloted the tool with support for three languages and text-based abuse. For the project to continue and operate well in the existing languages, we need support to continue growing the slur list. The slurs used on social media morph rapidly, and the list needs to evolve to capture and detect these slurs. We would also like to update the dataset used for hate speech detection since this too will evolve over time. For now, we have finances earmarked to maintain the technical infrastructure till the end of 2022. We could also use financial support to run the infrastructure beyond 2022.

In terms of functionality, the tool can grow to include more languages, and more media modalities (image and video-based abuse). We can also build out some of the other [features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ29pzrZtFOxgb5yPgA1a-y_0LZbGRureUx0E0LZvRx2VgqANOYrAvDNuqYHQMpVcQPgH3ql-52YSu9/pub) requested by the activists in our design workshops. These included ways to make reporting on platforms easier; and functionality to flag viral or coordinated content.

Finally, this project engages with some difficult and critical questions around machine learning, the democratization of technology, expertise and online safety. Any support for research in these areas helps us refine our conception for the work, while also contributing to action-centred research in these areas.
