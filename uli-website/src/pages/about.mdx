## About Uli

Navigating the online world has increasingly become reflective of the offline world: targeted gender-based violence against all gender and sexual minorities is now commonplace. Uli (meaning chisel in Tamil) is our attempt to hand the chisel and power over to users most affected by online gender-based violence. Uli invites each one of us to gather around and take control of our experience on social media platforms. With Uli, we lay the groundwork to demand more responsible and proactive tech from the powers to be.

This plugin is also an ode to the efforts of different groups, organizations and movements that strive to empower each one of us. It was born from the collective labour of journalists, activists, community influencers, and writers engaged in the struggle against the interwoven caste, religion, gender and sexuality-based violence both online and offline. They have contributed towards the development of this plugin that allows us to filter out offensive words/phrases, call our friends for help or start online conversations, and archive problematic tweets. This plugin is a reminder of our ability to reclaim spaces and take control of our online experience.

Uli is not the final product, rather it’s a simple tool, a chisel, that allows one to make a room of one’s own or courtyards where people can come together, share stories, and reflect on the future we all want to see.
