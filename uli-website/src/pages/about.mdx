## Support the Project

Broadly, the project would require support for:

- Research and technical development
- Compensating expert annotators
- Infrastructure cost

In the first year, we piloted the tool with support for three languages and text-based abuse. For the project to continue and operate well in the existing languages, we need support to continue growing the slur list. The slurs used on social media morph rapidly, and the list needs to evolve to capture and detect these slurs. We would also like to update the dataset used for hate speech detection since this too will evolve over time. For now, we have finances earmarked to maintain the technical infrastructure till the end of 2022. We could also use financial support to run the infrastructure beyond 2022.

In terms of functionality, the tool can grow to include more languages, and more media modalities (image and video-based abuse). We can also build out some of the other [features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ29pzrZtFOxgb5yPgA1a-y_0LZbGRureUx0E0LZvRx2VgqANOYrAvDNuqYHQMpVcQPgH3ql-52YSu9/pub) requested by the activists in our design workshops. These included ways to make reporting on platforms easier; and functionality to flag viral or coordinated content.

Finally, this project engages with some difficult and critical questions around machine learning, the democratization of technology, expertise and online safety. Any support for research in these areas helps us refine our conception for the work, while also contributing to action-centred research in these areas.
