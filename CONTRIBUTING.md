# ðŸ‘‹ Say Hi

The very first thing you should do is letting us know that you are interested in contributing by the following means :

If you are unsure about how to contribute to Uli, simply join our [slack](https://admin417477.typeform.com/to/nVuNyG?typeform-source=tattle.co.in), introduce yourself and mention what interests you about the project. We'll reach out and assist you further.

If there's a particular improvement or feature you want to suggest, or a bug in Uli you want to fix, simply create a Github Issue regarding it and we'll reach out to assist you further.

If you are interested in knowing what we are working on right now, head over to the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/tattle-made/projects/30). If any issue there interests you, comment on it for any clarification.

If you are leaning towards working on our codebase, you might find our [learning guide](https://github.com/tattle-made/Uli/wiki/Uli-Learning-Guide) useful. This will help you expedite whatever you need to learn to be an effective contributor.

# ðŸ”¨ Do your thing
You should be able to run Uli on your own machine by following the instructions on one of our [setup guides](https://github.com/tattle-made/Uli/wiki/Setup-Uli-on-Linux-for-Chrome). If you prefer, we have a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwSnEe3-fL8) as well. Once you have identified the issue you want to work on, make a fork of our repository and get to coding.


## Pair programming

We offer pair programming sessions with community members to familiarize them with the product and the code base. This will give you an opportunity to clarify any doubts regarding the codebase and the features that interest you. Do ping us on the issue or on slack if you would like to sign up for it.

# ðŸ“ž Tell us via Pull Request

All code changes happen via pull request. We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). The easiest way to let us know if you want to combine your changes into the core code is to make a Pull Request (PR)

In your PR, please mention the following :

- What does this PR do?
- How do we test this PR?

We don't strictly follow test driven development (TDD) but any contributions that include tests are greatly appreciated.

# ðŸŽ‰ Celebrate

We typically review a PR within 2-5 days. We might offer you some feedback to your PR and merge it! If you reached till this stage, Congratulations and join us afterwards for virtual coffee/tea on slack ðŸ™‚

# Licence

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same licence that covers the project - GPL-3. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
