This file describes the long-term roadmap for Uli. 

Based on focus group discussions with activists and researchers in late 2021, we identified the following needs across different user-groups:

Through the first year, we focused on building the ones highlighted in green. 

After the pilot, team members listed what they felt were desirable improvements and/or next set of features (closer to the center implies more critical):

Based on feedback from the team as well as users, we have converged on the following two year roadmap:

**Year 1:**
* Slur replacement functional for all websites (currently only working on Twitter)
* See explanations of slur on hover.
* Ability for users to grow and compare slur list (access control)
* Uli used in 4 university/ training programs.

**Year 2:**
* Build features for search and linkages of archives for research.
* Expand to audiovisual content.
* Advocacy and marketing of Uli.

By the end of year 2, we aim to make Uli self-sustaining by charging for premium features and/or specialized services to community moderators and/or trust and safety teams. For the two year roadmap we are looking for ~500K USD to support across technical development, partnerships, research and communications. 100K if this amount has been met through the Mozilla [Digital Future's Lab](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-welcomes-2023-data-futures-lab-cohort/) program. If you would like a detailed breakdown of the budget and/or Uli sustainability plan, or have feedback on this roadmap, please reach out to tarunima@tattle.co.in.
